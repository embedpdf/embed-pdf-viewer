# Svelte PDF Viewer

EmbedPDF offers two ways to add PDF viewing to your Svelte application. Choose the approach that fits your project.

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card
    title="Drop-in Viewer"
    description="A complete, pre-built PDF viewer with toolbar and thumbnails. Import, configure, done."
    href="/docs/svelte/viewer/introduction"
    arrow
  />
  <Cards.Card
    title="Headless Components"
    description="Build a completely custom viewer using our stores and unstyled components. Total UI freedom."
    href="/docs/svelte/headless/introduction"
    arrow
  />
</Cards>

## Which should I choose?

| Use Case | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| I need a viewer up and running in minutes | **Drop-in Viewer** |
| I want to match my app's design system exactly | **Headless Components** |
| I need a simple document preview | **Drop-in Viewer** |
| I'm building a document editor or annotation tool | **Headless Components** |
| I want the smallest possible bundle size | **Headless Components** |
| I don't want to write any UI code | **Drop-in Viewer** |

## Technology

Both options are powered by the same high-performance engine:

- **PDFium via WebAssembly** — The same rendering engine used in Google Chrome
- **Virtualization** — Only renders visible pages, handling 1000+ page documents smoothly
- **First-class TypeScript** — Full type definitions for a great developer experience
- **Tree-shakeable** — Import only what you use
