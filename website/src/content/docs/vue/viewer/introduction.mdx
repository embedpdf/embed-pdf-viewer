# Drop-in Viewer

The `@embedpdf/vue-pdf-viewer` package provides a complete, production-ready PDF viewing experience for Vue applications.

It is designed to be the fastest way to get a high-quality PDF viewer into your app. You don't need to build toolbars, handle layout logic, or worry about CSS—it just works.

## Key Features

- **Ready-to-use UI** — Includes a polished toolbar, sidebar, and thumbnails.
- **Responsive** — Adapts seamlessly to mobile and desktop screens.
- **Themable** — Built-in light/dark modes and support for custom brand colors.
- **Configurable** — Easily disable features you don't need (e.g., printing or downloading).
- **TypeScript** — Fully typed for a great developer experience.

## When to Use

Choose the **Drop-in Viewer** if:

- You need a standard PDF viewer (like Acrobat or Chrome's viewer).
- You want to save development time and avoid building UI from scratch.
- You don't need to radically change the layout or design system.

If you need complete control over every pixel, a custom toolbar layout, or a unique viewing experience, consider using our [Headless Composables](/docs/vue/headless/introduction) instead.
