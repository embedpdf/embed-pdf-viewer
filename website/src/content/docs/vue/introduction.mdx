# Headless PDF Components for Vue

EmbedPDF for Vue is a **headless UI toolkit** for building powerful, fully-customized PDF viewing and editing experiences in Vue 3.

Unlike traditional PDF libraries that provide a monolithic, pre-styled `<PDFViewer>` component, EmbedPDF gives you a set of unopinionated composables and components. This gives you complete control over your application's layout, styling, and functionality.

Think of it like this: instead of a pre-built car, we give you a high-performance engine (`@embedpdf/engines`), a chassis (`<EmbedPDF>`), and a set of quality parts (plugins, composables, and components) that you assemble to build the exact vehicle you need.

## What Does "Headless" Mean?

1.  **You Control the UI:** We provide the logic, you provide the pixels. The library does not ship with any CSS or pre-built toolbars. You can use any styling solution you prefer, from scoped CSS in your SFCs to component frameworks like Vuetify or utility-class frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

2.  **Composable by Design:** You build your viewer by composing components and slots. Need a render layer? Add the `<RenderLayer />` component. Want a search UI? Use the `useSearch` composable and build the interface you want. This keeps your component tree clean and your bundle size minimal.

3.  **Total Layout Freedom:** Our components are simple building blocks designed to fit inside *your* application's layout, not the other way around. You decide where the viewport goes, where the sidebar lives, and how the toolbar is structured.

## The Core Building Blocks

Your entire PDF experience is built from a few key concepts:

- **`<EmbedPDF>` Component**: The root provider that manages the core engine and orchestrates all the plugins.
- **Plugins**: These are the "brains" of your viewer, adding features like zooming, scrolling, searching, and more.
- **Composables**: Functions like `useZoom()` or `useScroll()` that allow your components to read and react to the state of the PDF viewer.
- **Components**: Unstyled, functional components like `<RenderLayer />` and `<Scroller />` that handle the actual rendering and interaction within the DOM, often using scoped slots.
