# Headless Components

EmbedPDF React's headless library is an **unopinionated UI toolkit** for building fully customized PDF experiences.

Unlike the [Drop-in Viewer](/docs/react/viewer/introduction) which gives you a pre-built interface, the headless library provides the logic (hooks) and rendering primitives (components) but **zero styling**. You are responsible for building the UI—toolbars, buttons, and layout.

## Core Concepts

1.  **You Control the UI:** We provide the logic, you provide the pixels. Use your own button components, your own CSS (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, etc.), and your own layout.
2.  **Composable by Design:** Build your viewer by composing specialized components (`<RenderLayer />`, `<Zoom />`) and hooks (`useSearch`, `useSelection`).
3.  **Minimal Bundle Size:** Import only the plugins you need. If you don't need annotations, don't import the plugin.

## When to Use

Choose **Headless Components** if:

- You need to match your application's design system exactly.
- You are building a specialized viewer (e.g., review, or split-pane layouts).
- You want to integrate PDF features into an existing UI workflow.
- You need the smallest possible bundle size.

## Comparison

| Feature | Drop-in Viewer | Headless Components |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes | Hours |
| **UI Customization** | Theme colors, toggle features | 100% Control |
| **Bundle Size** | Larger (includes full UI) | Minimal (tree-shakeable) |
| **Best For** | Standard viewing | Custom apps & design systems |
