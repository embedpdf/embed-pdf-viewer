# EmbedPDF Snippet

The EmbedPDF Snippet is a **production-ready PDF viewer** that you can drop into any web application in minutes.

Unlike our [Headless Libraries](../), which require you to build your own user interface from scratch, the Snippet comes "batteries included." It provides a polished, professional UI with toolbars, sidebars, search, annotations, and more—right out of the box.

Think of it like a premium car: you don't need to build the engine or design the dashboard. You just get in, turn the key, and drive.

## Why Use the Snippet?

1.  **Instant Integration:** Add a powerful PDF viewer to your site with just a few lines of code. No complex build steps or deep React knowledge required.
2.  **Polished UI:** Get a professionally designed interface that handles zooming, scrolling, searching, and thumbnails automatically.
3.  **Framework Agnostic:** Works everywhere. Whether you use React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, or plain HTML/jQuery, the Snippet (and its framework wrappers) fits right in.
4.  **Customizable:** While it comes with a UI, it's not rigid. You can easily theme colors, toggle features on/off, and configure behavior via a simple configuration object.

## When to Choose What?

| Feature | **EmbedPDF Snippet** | **Headless Libraries** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | Rapid development, standard use cases, non-technical teams. | Highly custom UIs, deep integration, unique design systems. |
| **UI Control** | Configuration-based (themes, toggles). | 100% control (you write the JSX/HTML). |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes. | Hours/Days (depending on complexity). |
| **Bundle Size** | Larger (includes UI code). | Minimal (you only import what you use). |

> **Need total control?** If you need to build a viewer that looks *exactly* like your app, or if you need to integrate PDF logic into a completely custom workflow without our standard toolbar, check out our **[Headless PDF Components](../)**.
