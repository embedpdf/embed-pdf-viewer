# Using with React

While `@embedpdf/engines` is a framework-agnostic library, it includes a dedicated React hook, `usePdfiumEngine`, to simplify integration and manage the engine's lifecycle within your components.

This is the recommended way to get started with EmbedPDF in a React application.

## Installation

The `usePdfiumEngine` hook is included directly within the main package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @embedpdf/engines
````

## The `usePdfiumEngine` Hook

This hook handles the creation of the PDF engine, manages its loading state, and provides you with a ready-to-use `engine` instance. The engine is fully initialized when returned—no additional setup required.

Here's a basic example of how to use it in a component:

```tsx filename="PDFProcessor.tsx"
import { usePdfiumEngine } from '@embedpdf/engines/react';

export const PDFProcessor = () => {
  const { engine, isLoading, error } = usePdfiumEngine();

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  if (isLoading || !engine) {
    return <div>Loading PDF Engine...</div>;
  }

  // Engine is ready to use immediately!
  return (
    <div>
      <p>PDF Engine is ready to use!</p>
      {/* You can now pass the `engine` prop to other components */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
