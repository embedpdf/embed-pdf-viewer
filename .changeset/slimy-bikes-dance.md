feat: Add Svelte 5 adapter (`/svelte` export) with Rune-based hooks (`useRegistry`, `usePlugin`, `useCapability`, `useCoreState`) and components (`EmbedPDF`, `AutoMount`, `NestedWrapper`). Enhanced core `Store` to prevent dispatches within reducers. Thanks to @andrewrisse for the Svelte integration work!
